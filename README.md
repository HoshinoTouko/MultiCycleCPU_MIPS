# MultiCycleCPU_MIPS

## Overview

This is a MultiCycle CPU Project based on MIPS Instruction Set.

42 Instructions supported. Check it at [doc/Instructions.md](doc/Instructions.md)

**DO NOT SUPPORT** interrupts and overflow.

## About test result (Teaching assistant watch here)

For a more convenient test, I split the full test .asm file into 2 subsets: (1 to 3) and (4 to 5). I add a loop at the end of test .asm file (1 to 3).
